                    <h2>1. WHAT IS A COOKIE?</h2>
                    <p>Cookies are small text files that a website stores on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website, mobile application or click on links in certain marketing emails. During subsequent visits to that website or mobile application, cookies are recognized by the website owner or the various people who set them. Cookies are important to the proper functioning of our Sites and are used to distinguish you from other visitors to the Sites in order to record your preferences, create a personalized user experience, understand Site usage patterns or for marketing purposes. Other tracking technologies include web beacons, Java scripts, entity tags, and HTML5 local storage.</p>
                    <p><b>Cookies:</b> Cookies are small data files sent from a website's server and stored on your device's hard drive, either only for the duration of your visit or for a specified period of time. Cookies contain information that can be read later by a web server.</p>
                    <p><b>Web beacons:</b> These are small transparent images embedded in web pages, apps, and emails that are sometimes called "clear GIFs," "single-pixel GIFs," "page tags," or "spy pixels." We use web beacons to track the web pages you visit, to check the effectiveness of our marketing, and to see if an email has been opened and acted upon.</p>
                    <p><b>JavaScript:</b> JavaScript is a piece of code embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitates various operations, such as speeding up the update frequency of certain features or monitoring the usage of various online components.</p>
                    <p><b>Entity tags:</b> Entity tags are HTTP code mechanisms that allow parts of websites to be stored or "cached" in the browser and allow them to be cached when the website is open, thus speeding up performance from the website, as the web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed.</p>
                    <p><b>HTML5 Local Storage:</b> HTML5 local storage allows you to store or "cache" website data in the browser to save and retrieve HTML5 page data when viewing the website.</p>
                    <h2>2. DO YOU HAVE TO ALLOW COOKIES?</h2>
                    <p>No, you do not need to enable cookies unless they are necessary (or "strictly necessary") for the Sites to function, as described below. However, if you do disable them, you should be aware that the Site may not load as expected and your browsing experience may be less convenient.</p>
                    <h2>3. ARE THERE ANY KEY TERMS I NEED TO KNOW?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, there is a terminology that will allow you to better understand the use of cookies and make informed decisions about it. This includes first-party and third-party cookies and session and persistent cookies.</p>
                    <p><b>First-party and third-party cookies:</b> Whether a cookie is "first-party" or "third-party" refers to the domain in which the cookie is set. This means that a first party cookie is a cookie set by the operator of the website or application being accessed. Third-party cookies are cookies set by a domain other than the website or application you visit, for example, through a website analytics provider. When you use our Sites, we may allow third parties to collect device and usage information, as well as location information on your individual devices through mobile software development kits. Third party cookies may include the different types of cookies described below.</p>
                    <p><b>Session and persistent cookies:</b> Session cookies are temporary cookies that allow a website operator to understand the actions taken on a website when a browser session is open. These cookies are deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies, on the other hand, remain in the visitor's browser or hard drive for the time specified as the expiration date for that cookie.</p>
                    <h2>4. WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE?</h2>

For this reason, mandatory cookies do not require your consent.</p>

                    <p><b>Functional Cookies:</b> Functional Cookies collect information about how visitors use our Site, such as which pages visitors go to most often, what error messages they receive, and other analytics information.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of these cookies is to allow us to count visits and traffic to our Site so that we can measure and improve its performance. When we know which pages are the most and least popular, and how visitors navigate the Site, we are better able to create pages that visitors like. The information collected by these cookies is aggregated.</p>
                    <p>Functional cookies also allow the site to remember choices made by a user (such as language or region) and offer enhanced and more personalized features. These cookies may be used to remember changes a visitor has made to text size or fonts, or to provide services a visitor has requested, such as watching a video or leaving a comment on the Site.</p>
                    <h2>5. WHAT OTHER INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT THROUGH COOKIES?</h2>
